In 2018, I saw a specific niche, and decided that unless I take the leap, I will forever be waiting for that opportunity. Luckily, in 2018 and even more now in 2020, serverless technology stack was already appearing, and it made so much sense when you are a lean start up needing to build fast, test fast, and rebuild even faster. Today, there are even more components that we can integrate and plug into our systems. This is a story of a lean serverless startup and why I couldn't have done this without serverless. I hope it inspires you to also take your dream idea, and build it to test it.",

However, if we think about manual regression tests, they are not only time consuming and repeatable, but also feedback time is quite high. These are the reasons why regression tests are often automated. But what if we have more and more tests and even automated execution of them takes too much time - 10 minutes... 30 minutes... maybe even hours? During this session, you will see how the serverless cloud services like AWS Lambda may be used to run tests in the highly parallelized environment that can speed up test execution even hundreds of times.",

We know that serverless requires a new mindset and a different way of approaching application development. When business pressure mounts to deliver solutions faster, organisations often fall into the trap of quickly building a team by pulling engineers from different sources in order to satisfy the business goals. In this talk, taking inspiration from the nature, I will take you through few important phases of growing a serverless team, and discuss how it can bring near term as well as long term benefits to an organisation.

        "title": "An app modernization story with Cloud Run",
        "abstract": "Back in 2016, I deployed an ASP.NET monolith app to IIS on Windows. It worked but it was clunky in every sense of the word. Over the years, the app was freed from Windows (thanks to .NET Core), containerized to run consistently in different environments (thanks to Docker) and decomposed into a set of loosely-coupled, event-driven, microservices (thanks to Cloud Run). The end result is a simpler and portable serverless architecture that's much cheaper to run and maintain. In this talk, we'll go through the modernization journey, explore the decision points and deep dive into the final architecture and code.",
